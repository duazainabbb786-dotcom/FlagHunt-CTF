MALWARE ANALYSIS CTF - HACKER THEME
====================================

DESCRIPTION:
------------
A realistic malware analysis Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge with a sophisticated hacker theme. This interactive web application simulates a real malware analysis environment where users must analyze a malicious executable step-by-step and capture hidden flags through proper analysis techniques.

FLAGS TO CAPTURE:
-----------------
1. Flag 1: FLAG{PE32_WINDOWS_EXE}
   - Found by: Analyzing file type using 'file' command
   - Location: File inspection output shows "PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows"

2. Flag 2: FLAG{STRING_ANALYSIS_COMPLETE}
   - Found by: Extracting strings and finding C2 server URL
   - Location: Strings output contains C2 domain and flag hint

3. Flag 3: FLAG{SHA256_HASH_IDENTIFIED}
   - Found by: Calculating SHA256 hash of malware
   - Location: Hash output and analysis comments

4. Flag 4: FLAG{C2_TRAFFIC_ANALYZED}
   - Found by: Analyzing network traffic pcap file
   - Location: C2 beaconing analysis and traffic patterns

5. Flag 5: FLAG{REVERSED_PAYLOAD}
   - Found by: Reverse engineering the binary
   - Location: Disassembly shows printf with flag string

AUTHOR NOTES:
-------------
This CTF is designed for educational purposes to teach basic malware analysis concepts in a safe, simulated environment. The challenges represent real-world analysis techniques used by cybersecurity professionals.

All animations and transitions are implemented with pure CSS for optimal performance. The design features a cohesive cyberpunk aesthetic with glitch effects, neon colors, and futuristic UI elements.

The flags are intentionally placed within the analysis output to simulate real CTF challenges where participants must analyze data to find hidden flags.

Enjoy the challenge!
